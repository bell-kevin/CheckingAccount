# CheckingAccount
You created a savings account in the example. In this project, create a Checking Account. A Checking Account has a current balance and a fee charged for each transaction. The transactions are making a deposit and making a withdrawal. In this project, use a loop to let the user select different transactions. Assume all data entered will be valid â€“ positive numbers, and not greater than the current balance in the account.  Create a project named Ch6Checking. Create a class named CheckingAccount. In the methods for withdrawal and deposit, after adjusting the balance by the amount of change, subtract the fee.  In the driver class, create a CheckingAccount object named checking, and ask the user for the beginning balance and the fee for this checking account. In a loop, ask the user to select options to deposit, withdraw, or quit. Use a Switch structure to process the choice. Print the new balance after each transaction, with properly formatted numbers. Note the placement of dollar signs before the user input. That is printed by your code, the user does not type a dollar sign.  Take a screenshot of the execution that matches the sample session. Run it again and do a withdrawal first, then a deposit, and take a screenshot of that session.     Submission: the specified screenshots, and the root folder for the project     Pay careful attention to the rubric for this assignment. Remember the standards that apply to every project.  Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.  Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine, and the assignment will be marked with a zero.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
